## Preface

Two weeks ago, I was given the opportunity at my workplace to work on a new backend microservice. It goes without saying that it was an honor for me to be asked to work on this project, but at the same time it turned out to be a fast track straight out of my daily comfort zone and into the deep end of a pool‚Äîawesome!

The first week consisted of technical spec writing, presenting, and getting asked questions that I coudn't answer about topics I didn't previously know about:

- Do you have a reconciliation plan?
- How will you protect against duplicate writes?
- Are your endpoints idempotent?
- How are you handling retry logic?
- Have you considered event-sourcing?

### SQL + Database Goals

I've previously relied on an ORM, like [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/), to do my relational data bidding on personal projects so I never actually picked up SQL‚Äîit's like I've been riding a bicycle with training wheels. However, ORM usage was not approved for this service so I needed to get up to speed in SQL, from basically nothing‚Äînever wrote production level SQL, barely even wrote any hobby level SQL‚Äîand **fast**.

With all that said, I wanted to write about the SQL and database parts chunks of knowledge I picked up, mostly so I don't forget, and so that I have an embarassing blog post to look back on in the future. ü§£

## Idempotence

I think this is a word that you seldom hear if your world is strictly frontend development.

So what is [idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)?

Idempotence is a property of an operation such that running it 1000 times will have the same effect as running it once (successfully).

Here's my real-life analogy/scenario of idempotence:

> _Given a volume knob that goes from 0 up to 11_
>
> _Turning the volume up by one is not idempotent_
>
> _Turning the volume up to max is idempotent_

### Code

Here are two, beyond basic SQL snippets. One is idempotent and the other is not.

#### ‚ùå Not idempotent

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION "pgcrypto";
```

Assuming you're operating on a single database, this will work the very first time you run it, but every following run will produce an error result. Postgres will throw an error if you try to create an extention that already exists.

| Run  | Result | Stdout                              |
| :--- | :----- | :---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Ok     |                                     |
| 2    | Error  | extension "pgcrypto" already exists |
| 3    | Error  | extension "pgcrypto" already exists |
| n... | Error  | extension "pgcrypto" already exists |

There are **two different** outcomes‚ÄîOk and Error‚Äîso this is not idempotent.

#### ‚úÖ Idempotent

One way to make the previous operation idempotent is to check for previous existence of your extension, row, constraint, or anything, and do nothing if it already exists.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
```

This is idempotent because no matter how many times you run this operation beyond the first successful run, it always produces the same outcome‚ÄîOk.

| Run  | Result | Stdout                                        |
| :--- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Ok     |                                               |
| 2    | Ok     | extension "pgcrypto" already exists, skipping |
| 3    | Ok     | extension "pgcrypto" already exists, skipping |
| n... | Ok     | extension "pgcrypto" already exists, skipping |

## Atomicity

Another term that isn't part of the typical frontend repertoire.

What is [atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>)?

Atomicity represents the "A" in [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) transaction properties.

The best way I can describe an **atomic** [database transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction) is that its operations are **_all or nothing_**. All of them must succeed for changes to be committed to the database, or else nothing is committed.

And yet another analogy üôÉ:

> _You're looking for a match in Dota 2_
>
> _All 10 players are required to confirm readiness in order for a match to begin_
>
> _9 players confirm_
>
> _1 player is AFK, doesn't confirm, and the match times out_
>
> _You're all sent back to the matchmaking queue, and no match was recorded_

### Code

Here's an exapmle using real SQL. Take this table, **"friends"**, for example...

| column_name | data_type  |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| username    | varchar(8) |

#### ‚ùå Not atomic

The following SQL is not atomic. It will insert `'peas'`, `'in'`, and `'a'`, committing each to the database. It will fail to insert `'poooooooooood'` due to character length, and your "friends" table will be sad üò¢.

```sql
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('peas');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('in');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('a');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('poooooooooood');
-- ERROR:  value too long for type character varying(8)

```

#### ‚úÖ Atomic

The standard approach to making this atomic is to use a **transaction**. The [BEGIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-begin.html) keyword starts a transaction block and [COMMIT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-commit.html) commits the current transaction. If any operations inside the transaction fail, nothing gets committed.

The following SQL **is** atomic.

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('peas');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('in');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('a');
INSERT INTO friends (username) VALUES('poooooooooood');
COMMIT;
```

`'peas'`, `'in'` and `'a'` are all inserted, but not committed yet. `'poooooooooood'` eventually causes an exception to be raised and the entire transaction gets rolled back, resulting in nothing getting committed to the database.

## Applying Concepts

For me, reading typically gets me nowhere. I absolutely have to move things around, and make mistakes to better understand and ingrain concepts.

### My Sandbox

Here's a distilled layout of the application code that I used to go about tinkering.

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json (for `@pgtyped/cli`)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 00001-Example.sql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sql

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.sql

```

<details>
<summary>Dependencies</summary>

```bash

yarn add -D @types/pg
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>tsconfig.json</summary>

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNEXT",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

</details>

### Docker Postgres Container

I chose to run a [Docker Postgres container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres), as opposed to installing and running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) directly on my computer. Why? I believe this is a more isolated and reproducible way of going about development.

```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name my-postgres-container \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -d \
  -p 8080:5432 postgres:13-alpine
```

<details>
<summary>Flags explained...</summary>

- `--rm`: Tells Docker to remove the container when it is stopped.
- `--name my-postgres`: Names your container.
- `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword`: Sets an environment variable for your container. You can specify multiple `-e` flags.
- `-d`: Starts the container in "detached" mode. This prevents your current terminal window from being _eaten up_.
- `-p 8080:5432`: Publishes a port. This specific command maps the container's `port 5432` to the host's (likely your computer) `port 8080`.
- `postgres:13-alpine` This is the Docker image and tag to use. Docker first checks if you have the `postgres:13-alpine` image locally, and pulls it from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) if you don't.

</details>

#### Psql inside Docker

I didn't have a need for this, but if for any reason you need to modify users, privileges, or do anything with `psql`, you can `exec` into the Docker container directly.

```bash
docker exec -it my-postgres-container bash

# Inside the docker container
# bash-5.0#

# Verify the `psql` CLI tool is installed
which psql
# /usr/local/bin/psql

# Use `psql` with the default user
psql -U postgres

# Connected to Postgres
# psql (13beta2)
# Type "help" for help.

# postgres=#

# Quit Postgres
\q
```

### Migrations

I used a small library called [postgres-migrations](https://github.com/ThomWright/postgres-migrations) to simplify running migrations for me, in-code.

```sql
BEGIN;

-- #1
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";

-- #2
-- Depends on #1 for uuid_generate_v4()
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "users" (
  "id" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "username" character varying (25) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "uq_users_username" UNIQUE ("username"),
  CONSTRAINT "pk_users_id" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- #3
-- Depends on #1 for uuid_generate_v4()
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "comments" (
  "id" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "body" character varying (25) NOT NULL,
  "user_id" uuid NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "pk_comments_id" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- #4
-- Depends on #3 for creating the "comments" table
ALTER TABLE "comments"
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "fk_comments_user_id";

-- #5
-- Depends on #3 for creating the "comments" table
-- Depends on #4 for removing an existing constraint
ALTER TABLE "comments"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_comments_user_id"
  FOREIGN KEY ("user_id")
  REFERENCES "users" (id);

COMMIT;
```

### PgTyped

This library has been pretty interesting in terms of writing raw SQL. You can run `pgtyped` in "watch mode", and it will connect to your database, and validate your SQL queries and auto generate TypeScript types and functions.

`./sql/example.sql`

```SQL
/* @name getOrCreateUser */
WITH temp AS (
  INSERT INTO users (id, username)
  SELECT :id, :username
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM users
    WHERE id = :id)
  RETURNING *
)
SELECT * FROM temp
UNION
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = :id;

/* @name insertComment */
INSERT INTO comments (body, user_id)
VALUES (:body, :userId);
```

Running `npx pgtyped -w -c config.json` generates an adjacent file, `./sql/example.queries.ts`

### Tinkering

Here's a chunk of code. In a nutshell, it creates a `user`, and iterates over a 50 x 50 matrix, inserting 2500 `comments` into the database.

`./index.ts`

```ts
import { Client } from "pg"
import { createDb, migrate } from "postgres-migrations"

import {
  getOrCreateUser,
  IGetOrCreateUserParams,
  insertComment,
  IInsertCommentParams,
} from "./sql/example.queries"

const host = "localhost"
const port = 8080
const user = "postgres"
const password = "mysecretpassword"
const database = "postgres"

const client = new Client({
  host,
  port,
  user,
  password,
  database,
})

const outerFifty = Array(50)
  .fill(null)
  .map(() => Array(50).fill(null))

async function main() {
  await client.connect()
  await createDb(database, { client })
  await migrate({ client }, "./migrations")

  try {
    await client.query("BEGIN")

    let params: IGetOrCreateUserParams = {
      id: "a5f5d36a-6677-41c2-85b8-7578b4d98972",
      username: "test_user",
    }
    const [user] = await getOrCreateUser.run(params, client)
    console.log(`ü§ñ User:`, user.id)
    console.log("üìù Generating comments...")

    console.time("‚è∞ Generating comments took")
    const outerPromises = outerFifty.map((innerFity, outerIndex) => {
      const innerPromises = innerFity.map((_, innerIndex) => {
        let params = {
          body: `${outerIndex}__${innerIndex}`,
          userId: user.id,
        } as IInsertCommentParams
        return insertComment.run(params, client)
      })
      return Promise.allSettled(innerPromises)
    })
    await Promise.allSettled(outerPromises)
    console.timeEnd("‚è∞ Generating comments took")

    await client.query("COMMIT")
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(`Error: `, e)
    console.log(`‚ùå ROLLBACK`)
    await client.query("ROLLBACK")
  } finally {
    await client.end()
  }
}
main()
```

`yarn start`

```
Œª yarn start
yarn run v1.22.4
$ ts-node .
ü§ñ User: a5f5d36a-6677-41c2-85b8-7578b4d98972
üìù Generating comments...
‚è∞ Generating comments took: 5341.766ms
‚ú®  Done in 7.25s.
```

### Isolation

The SQL in this script takes roughly 6 seconds to finish.

While the script is still running, if you go into a database GUI and try to run a query on the tables being operated on, Postgres waits:
