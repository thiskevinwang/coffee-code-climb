I started teaching myself Web development since about October, 2018. Why? I felt like I was going deeper and deeper down a dead-end point in my life and I needed an escape-hatch. Fortunately for me, I had my older brother as a guiding light in terms of how this extremely unknown field. He's quite a veteran and also super opinionated, so I basically treated his advice as the truth.

## iOS - June 2018

I had the tiniest bit of prior programming experience from teaching myself basic programming via Swift Playgrounds on my iPad, and learning on the job at [Eligible](https://eligible.com), since around June 2018. However, the gap between my fundamental skills and the complexity of the company's iOS app was too great for my learning to gain much traction.

I did get around to making a basic weather-map app, using Google & OpenWeatherMap's APIs, and that was a huge accomplishment for myself. But working on this project alone was really directionless, lonely, and I started to get burned out and lose interest.

## Web Development - Oct 2018

I turned to my brother to see _what else I could do_. He told me that learning just iOS was probably too limiting for me, and that behind every great mobile app is a great web application, framework, or API. So the next step was The Web.

> If you do start learning web development, you should checkout React. It's the hot new thing that everyone is using these days.

_"Say no more!"_ ...And so I jumped right into the ReactJS docs. I used my little terminal knowledge to get around to setting myself up with a local `create-react-app` project, and basically figuring out how all the pieces fit together. I essentially starting by trying to tackle **React**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** all at once. One of the first things I remember, was changing some CSS to make the React logo spin faster, I thought that was amazing.

In the months to come, I poured my acquired knowledge into my site and it went through many drastic transformations. I've saved some releases on the github repo for previous versions, but here's how it looks today, https://thekevinwang.com... and it continues to get more and more absurd.

## CS Fundamentals - Mar 2019

I've realized that a huge hole in my skill as a developer is sheer computer science fundamentals, like data structures, sorting algorithms. Like how great rock climbers are good because they've simply have some much mileage worth of movement on rock, I just need to spend more time working through problems, vocalizing my processes, and solving them.

I just received ["Computer Science Distilled"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0997316020/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thekevinwang-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0997316020&linkId=4b77ba68c0291183e71b35e35e4eb006) in the mail today, and it's been quite fascinating. I always preferred video games over books growing up, so enjoying a book (...that's not a cookbook) is very strange to me. A friend and fellow climber also recommended https://leetcode.com, which has been brutally difficult, but also very educational.
