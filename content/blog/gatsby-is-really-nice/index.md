No, Gatsby is really amazing.

This is all I have to say right now, as I'm trying to push as many changes as Ican as part of a ramp-up to get this blog up and running. It's 10:08 PM and I have to sleep soon, then get back to work tomorrow.

I'm learning Gatsby right now, as a I go, so here's the [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), for both you and me ðŸ˜†.

> Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast **websites** and **apps**

Here's a note to myself about my file structure...

```
blog
â”œ blog-post-name
  â”œ index.md
  â”œ optional-image.jpg
â”œ another-post-name
```
